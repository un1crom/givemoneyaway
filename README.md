*code inspiration*

I borrowed code from commenter on blog to get going.

Philip says:
I seem to be incorrect in the above. Tried it in Mathematica and even after millions of steps it does not converge to anything close to a single owner of all wealth.

ReverseSort@
Last@With[{n = 100, m = 1000000},
NestList[
Block[{x = #},
Scan[(If[x[[#]] > 0, x[[#]]â€“;
With[{j = RandomChoice[Delete[Range@n, #]]}, x[[j]]++]]) &,
Range@n]; x] &, ConstantArray[n, n], m]]
